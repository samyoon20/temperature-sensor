Temperature sensor with an Arduino

Built a mini temperature sensor using an Arduino, temperature reader, buzzer (to indicate whether the temperature is too hot or cold), rotary encoder (a visual representation of the temperature), and LEDs (to represent when the A/C is on, heater is on, or if at the perfect temperature).
